Team Members: Tessa-Lynn Weidmann, Veronica Chang, Yogasai Gazula, Allison Lee, and Satvik Shukla.

We used stats from top 50 guthub repositories (based on stars, forks, and trends) to get the industry standard for 'good' repositories. Given them, now one can compare any given repositry (the comments on the issues assigned) with that industry standard and get indiciations on how to be a more effective and efficient team.

Let us have coders be better leaders.
