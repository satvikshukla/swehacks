We used stats from top 50 github repositories (based on stars, forks, and trends) to get the industry standard for 'good' repositories. Given them, now one can compare any given repositry (the comments on the issues assigned) with that industry standard and get indiciations on how to be a more effective and efficient team.

Let us have coders be better leaders.

#### Instructions:
Install watson developer cloud and bokeh by using `pip install watson_developer_cloud` and `pip install bokeh`

Run call3.py after editing the username and password fields inside it to your own username and password.

To get a better analysis, try using a repository with more comments on issues.
